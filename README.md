# Image-and-video-processing-From-Mars-to-Hollywood-with-a-stop-at-the-hospital
This is the Image Processing course from Duke University by Guillermo Sapiro. I've included all quiz and assignment questions. I don't have my assignments in order. I've taken it from someone else and I really don't remember who that is. Whoever it is - Thanks a lot for keeping it so clean. Intention here is to only help those who are interested to learn.

## Overview
In this course, you will learn the science behind how digital images and video are made, altered, stored, and used. We will look at the vast world of digital imaging, from how computers and digital cameras form images to how digital special effects are used in Hollywood movies to how the Mars Rover was able to send photographs across millions of miles of space.

The course starts by looking at how the human visual system works and then teaches you about the engineering, mathematics, and computer science that makes digital images work. You will learn the basic algorithms used for adjusting images, explore JPEG and MPEG standards for encoding and compressing video images, and go on to learn about image segmentation, noise removal and filtering. Finally, we will end with image processing techniques used in medicine.
